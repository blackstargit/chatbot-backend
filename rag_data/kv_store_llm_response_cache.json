It is an energy-intensive proof of work blockchain with low speedy capability which makes it less efficient than other blockchains. Gleipner wanted to utilize this as an opportunity to build an alternate Ethereum network thatâd provide the consumers with a solution to these problems.\nOur solution: Our aim was to build an alternate ETH network with fewer transaction fees and a high transaction speed while still giving the features of ETH wallet and ETH balance to the users.

On the day of election, each Presiding officer after completing the voting of that specific constituency sign in via using their assigned credentials. They scan the QR code of the Electronic Voting Machine and upload the results using Mobile Application.\nOnce the Presiding officer uploads the results, it starts appearing on the Map in the portal. Higher authorities can see where voting has been closed, where its in progress and who is winning in which constituency.\nJOURNEY\nProblem: There are several significant drawbacks to regular voting systems, which include the need for paper, printing, and fuel. Overall management and operational overhead are also quite high, and results tend to be slow and full of human errors. These issues can all lead to decreased voter turnout and confidence in the election process.\nOur solution: The client wanted to build an election management  platform to pitch to the Pakistani government. They partnered with block360 to use blockchain to bring trust to internet voting.\nThe system also uses concepts of encryption and decryption. This prevents internal and external vote manipulation and provides end-to-end verifiability and audibility.\nRESULTS\nResults: We made their MVP based on four principles and based on that they were successfully able to engage the election commission of Pakistan and they got an expression of interest to provide a whole election management system to the government. And they were able to onboard the public institute and now their EMS development is in progress.\nTECHNOLOGIES\nAccording to the requirements provided by the client, we researched and chose the best technologies to implement the project in the most efficient manner. Technologies used are Solidity, Hardhat, NodeJS, NextJS, IPFS, Docker, and NGINX.\nMore Projects\nMore Projects\nElection Management System is a portal created for the management of election results received from Electronic Voting Machine.\nView Details\nA Platform where motor enthusiast and NFT collectors come together.

It does not exist in the traditional monetary systems, therefore we call it blockchain native stablecoin. It optimally reduces volatility and the risk of disorderly exchange-rate movements. To learn more about GSUc, read our introduction to the GSU exchange rate.\nYou can use many different collateral types which are voted in by GSU Governance to the GSU Protocol, including ETH and wrapped BTC. You can see each one by visiting GSUcoin.app with the corresponding Stability Fees and Minimum Collateralization Ratios.\nJOURNEY\nProblem: A fintech startup based in Denmark wanted to launch a centralized exchange platform to take their GSU unit to the market and to have an opportunity to generate ROI from trading services. For every national fiat currency, they wanted to create a wrap GSU. The aim was to take it to the market so people can trade it with their fiat currency and spend it as they need.\nOur solution: We provided them with their required centralized exchange platform called GSU Exchange. It is a secure, scalable, and ultra-low latency cryptocurrency trading platform built to match the high volatility of the crypto industry.\nWe developed the exchange using distributed and fault-tolerant technologies making it highly flexible and reliable. Its matching engine can work with any type of asset.\nRESULTS\nThey were able to secure a license from Danish Financial Authorities. Now, they are engaged in talks with banks to onboard them as legal partners. They will soon be putting it live for their operations.\nTECHNOLOGIES\nWe used the following technologies in the development of GSU Exchange: Solidity, Python, Next Framework, Shell, Docker, Nix, TS, Web3, Wallet Connect, Hardhat, Jest, Cache Server, GraphQL, NodeJS, TS, Oasis Spock, Market Maker Keepers, Auction Keepers, OSM, Settlements, MONGODB, Cypress, MixPanel, Pocket, Alchemy, Etherscan, GraphQL.\nMore Projects\nMore Projects\nElection Management System is a portal created for the management of election results received from Electronic Voting Machine.\nView Details\nA Platform where motor enthusiast and NFT collectors come together.

On the day of election, each Presiding officer after completing the voting of that specific constituency sign in via using their assigned credentials. They scan the QR code of the Electronic Voting Machine and upload the results using Mobile Application.\\nOnce the Presiding officer uploads the results, it starts appearing on the Map in the portal. Higher authorities can see where voting has been closed, where its in progress and who is winning in which constituency.\\nJOURNEY\\nProblem: There are several significant drawbacks to regular voting systems, which include the need for paper, printing, and fuel. Overall management and operational overhead are also quite high, and results tend to be slow and full of human errors. These issues can all lead to decreased voter turnout and confidence in the election process.\\nOur solution: The client wanted to build an election management  platform to pitch to the Pakistani government. They partnered with block360 to use blockchain to bring trust to internet voting.\\nThe system also uses concepts of encryption and decryption. This prevents internal and external vote manipulation and provides end-to-end verifiability and audibility.\\nRESULTS\\nResults: We made their MVP based on four principles and based on that they were successfully able to engage the election commission of Pakistan and they got an expression of interest to provide a whole election management system to the government. And they were able to onboard the public institute and now their EMS development is in progress.\\nTECHNOLOGIES\\nAccording to the requirements provided by the client, we researched and chose the best technologies to implement the project in the most efficient manner. Technologies used are Solidity, Hardhat, NodeJS, NextJS, IPFS, Docker, and NGINX.\\nMore Projects\\nMore Projects\\nElection Management System is a portal created for the management of election results received from Electronic Voting Machine.\\nView Details\\nA Platform where motor enthusiast and NFT collectors come together.

It does not exist in the traditional monetary systems, therefore we call it blockchain native stablecoin. It optimally reduces volatility and the risk of disorderly exchange-rate movements. To learn more about GSUc, read our introduction to the GSU exchange rate.\\nYou can use many different collateral types which are voted in by GSU Governance to the GSU Protocol, including ETH and wrapped BTC. You can see each one by visiting GSUcoin.app with the corresponding Stability Fees and Minimum Collateralization Ratios.\\nJOURNEY\\nProblem: A fintech startup based in Denmark wanted to launch a centralized exchange platform to take their GSU unit to the market and to have an opportunity to generate ROI from trading services. For every national fiat currency, they wanted to create a wrap GSU. The aim was to take it to the market so people can trade it with their fiat currency and spend it as they need.\\nOur solution: We provided them with their required centralized exchange platform called GSU Exchange. It is a secure, scalable, and ultra-low latency cryptocurrency trading platform built to match the high volatility of the crypto industry.\\nWe developed the exchange using distributed and fault-tolerant technologies making it highly flexible and reliable. Its matching engine can work with any type of asset.\\nRESULTS\\nThey were able to secure a license from Danish Financial Authorities. Now, they are engaged in talks with banks to onboard them as legal partners. They will soon be putting it live for their operations.\\nTECHNOLOGIES\\nWe used the following technologies in the development of GSU Exchange: Solidity, Python, Next Framework, Shell, Docker, Nix, TS, Web3, Wallet Connect, Hardhat, Jest, Cache Server, GraphQL, NodeJS, TS, Oasis Spock, Market Maker Keepers, Auction Keepers, OSM, Settlements, MONGODB, Cypress, MixPanel, Pocket, Alchemy, Etherscan, GraphQL.\\nMore Projects\\nMore Projects\\nElection Management System is a portal created for the management of election results received from Electronic Voting Machine.\\nView Details\\nA Platform where motor enthusiast and NFT collectors come together.

If you have 1 ether, you can use a g-bridge to convert it into the Gleipner network and you can spend these within the network.\\nThis solution also solves another thing: in ETH you pay gas fees so you pay two fees (app fees + gas fees).

The verification is done manually and very anxiously to prove that the user is legitimate.\nGuardian Portal: Guardian portal is said to be the controlling unit of the I-Voting application as it controls all the modules and phases of the election. There are 4 instances of guardians for the whole application and each guardian will have their own member portal.\nEach guardian publishes their public keys together with proofs of knowledge of the associated private keys.\nJOURNEY\nProblem: There are several significant drawbacks to regular voting systems, which include the need for paper, printing, and fuel. Overall management and operational overhead are also quite high, and results tend to be slow and full of human errors. Many people have concerns about the security and reliability of online voting and are worried that their votes could be intercepted or tampered with in some way.\nâ\nOur solution: Blockchain technology offers a solution to this problem and the iVoting System built by Block360 leverages it.\nThe client wanted to build an internet voting platform to pitch to the Pakistani government. They partnered with block360 to use blockchain to bring trust to internet voting. Based on their requirements, we build an internet voting system in which people can cast votes online.\nRESULTS\nResults: We made their MVP based on four principles and based on that they were successfully able to engage the election commission of Pakistan and they got an expression of interest to provide a whole election management system to the government.\nTECHNOLOGIES\nAccording to the requirements provided by the client, we researched and chose the best technologies to implement the project in the most efficient manner. Technologies used are Solidity, Hardhat, NodeJS, VueJS, IPFS, Docker, and NGINX.\nMore Projects\nMore Projects\nElection Management System is a portal created for the management of election results received from Electronic Voting Machine.\nView Details\nA Platform where motor enthusiast and NFT collectors come together.\n######################\nOutput:"

The verification is done manually and very anxiously to prove that the user is legitimate.\\nGuardian Portal: Guardian portal is said to be the controlling unit of the I-Voting application as it controls all the modules and phases of the election. There are 4 instances of guardians for the whole application and each guardian will have their own member portal.\\nEach guardian publishes their public keys together with proofs of knowledge of the associated private keys.\\nJOURNEY\\nProblem: There are several significant drawbacks to regular voting systems, which include the need for paper, printing, and fuel. Overall management and operational overhead are also quite high, and results tend to be slow and full of human errors. Many people have concerns about the security and reliability of online voting and are worried that their votes could be intercepted or tampered with in some way.\\nâ\\nOur solution: Blockchain technology offers a solution to this problem and the iVoting System built by Block360 leverages it.\\nThe client wanted to build an internet voting platform to pitch to the Pakistani government. They partnered with block360 to use blockchain to bring trust to internet voting. Based on their requirements, we build an internet voting system in which people can cast votes online.\\nRESULTS\\nResults: We made their MVP based on four principles and based on that they were successfully able to engage the election commission of Pakistan and they got an expression of interest to provide a whole election management system to the government.\\nTECHNOLOGIES\\nAccording to the requirements provided by the client, we researched and chose the best technologies to implement the project in the most efficient manner. Technologies used are Solidity, Hardhat, NodeJS, VueJS, IPFS, Docker, and NGINX.\\nMore Projects\\nMore Projects\\nElection Management System is a portal created for the management of election results received from Electronic Voting Machine.\\nView Details\\nA Platform where motor enthusiast and NFT collectors come together.\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Alphabase\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"Alphabase (formerly Block360 LLC) is a company that provides AI automation services and developed the iVoting system.

Anyone can invest as much as they want and get tokens against their investments.\nOn other hand eligible projects and ventures are funded by listing on Reals platform.\nOn investing in the Reals platform, users receive digital tokens(PKR) against real estate tokens purchased. These Tokens(PKR) are stored in the user's web wallet.\nUsing tokenization real estate investment makes it affordable for anyone. The cost of single Real token is the lowest investment price in real estate. Although traditional real estate paperwork takes 50,000 PKR to 1,000,000 PKR.\nJOURNEY\nThe Journey of Reals started when our client reached out with the request to build a Tokenization platform using Blockchain technology to make sure the security of the platform. A platform where people can create their own campaigns to collect investment and invest on otherâs campaigns.\nWe designed the solution to use Ethereum blockchain that would give investors the security and peace of mind required for the safe investment and ownership of tokenized assets. Moreover, the reason behind incorporating the Ethereum network with Reals is that it has positive feedback for issuing tokens on the network. On Ethereum blockchain the real work asset is legally represented as a token and has all the valuable qualities of a cryptographic token while holding the original value of the asset.\nAfter reaching an agreement, UX and UI were designed in close coordination with the client and then development started. After completing the development phase, the system was thoroughly tested and Demoed to mark this journey complete.\nRESULTS\nAs a result, Our client was able to submit the Reals project in SECP for the approval to make the project live for the public.\nTECHNOLOGIES\nAccording to the requirements provided by the client, we researched and chose the best technologies to implement the MVP in most efficient manner. Technologies we used are: Ethereum, NodeJS, React, Postgres, Docker, NGINX and Torus + Auth0.\nMore Projects\nMore Projects\nElection Management System is a portal created for the management of election results received from Electronic Voting Machine.\nView Details\nA Platform where motor enthusiast and NFT collectors come together.

In the coming months, team will be adding more and more collections and have a process for requesting your collection to be added to the website. If you own any NFTs from the collections we support at launch, you are eligible to get a beta access key. The NFT pass will unlock the premium membership to the platform, including the ability to boost your posts, feature your NFT etc.\nâ\nEvery single NFT will have its own journey from owner to owner with each of them having their own portion to contribute to the mythology of the NFT. To know more about Track the Myth visit the FAQs section of TTM.\nJOURNEY\nThis journey started with the client wanting to create an MVP that can support around 4 - 6 NFT collections and 400 - 600 beta users at the very least. That could allow them to prove to the NFT community that they are offering a legitimate service that will eventually launch with additional features at launch.\nWe proposed a solution to develop a Project that could convert this idea into a perfect reality. We designed the Prototypes and worked closely with the client to make sure the design is perfectly aligned with their ideas. After completing the design, our development team worked on completing the development phase by following scrum methodology. After completing the development, a testing phase was carried out in which all the feedback was incorporated.\nRESULTS\nAs a result of these efforts, Track the Myth has a landing page that gives information to users about the project and helps them connect their wallet to login into the user portal where they can use the portal as they want and enjoy all the functionalities we have worked on so far.\nTECHNOLOGIES\nTechnologies used in this projects are Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, React.js, Redux, Semantic UI, Web3.js, Truffle, Etherscan, Mocha, Heroku, and GitLab.\nMore Projects\nMore Projects\nElection Management System is a portal created for the management of election results received from Electronic Voting Machine.\nView Details\nA Platform where motor enthusiast and NFT collectors come together.

There are various factors that can be taken into account when rating the stability of an asset, including its track record of performance, the strength of the underlying market or industry, and the level of risk involved.\nSome common tools used for stable rating include credit ratings, which evaluate the ability of a borrower to repay their debts, and risk ratings, which assess the likelihood of an investment losing value.\nIt is important to note that the stability of an asset can change over time and that no rating system is foolproof. It is always a good idea to do your own research and due diligence before investing in any financial product.\nJOURNEY\nProblem: They wanted to make the GSU token accessible to people so we build this token on the ETH network.\nOur solution: We built this decentralized exchange, where people can come and buy the GSU token. It is a stable rating mechanism and this system is currently a patent, a proprietary system. So we built oracles, which provide information to blockchain networks. We used oracles to bring rates to this exchange.\nThey had built a global stability unit GSU.io along with their invention of a stable rate mechanism and now they wanted to make it accessible to people. We built it as an ERC20 on top of the ETH network. The token is upgradeable and has the support of the GSN network (eth gas station network so users don't have to pay the gas fee). They take their fee in GSU tokens so you can make the transaction without the gas fee.\nRESULTS\nResults: They were able to provide access to those who want access to GSU tokens through the ETH blockchain.\nTECHNOLOGIES\nTechnologies Used: VueJS, NodeJS, PostgresSQL, MariaDB, Redis, GoLang, Solidity, Ethereum, Bash, Docker\nMore Projects\nMore Projects\nElection Management System is a portal created for the management of election results received from Electronic Voting Machine.\nView Details\nA Platform where motor enthusiast and NFT collectors come together.

The lab aims to provide hands-on experience in processing and analyzing biological cell images through various steps, including grayscale conversion, histogram analysis, contrast normalization, thresholding, morphological operations, and connected component analysis. By the end of the lab, students should be able to apply these techniques effectively to extract and segment cells from complex images, understand the impact of each step on the segmentation process, and justify their choices based on visual inspection.\nData Set:\nMIVIA HEp-2 Image dataset (28 images, one per patient)\nProcess the images 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12 (The folder provided by the Lab instructor contains the binary mask labelled by expert is there just for reference)\nLabeled Segmented Cells (1455 individual cells)\nBinary masks describing the region of Interest (ROI)\n\nOutput:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation\n\n\n1. Grayscale Conversion: The First Lens\nThe foundation of digital image processing often begins with grayscale conversion. By eliminating color and focusing on intensity, we reduce computational complexity and isolate structural details. In this lab, RGB images were transformed using MATLAB's rgb2gray, which applies a weighted sum to retain perceptual brightness. This ensures the resulting image still reflects the inherent texture of cells, crucial for later stages.\n\n\n2. Histogram Analysis: Reading the Intensity Landscape\nHistograms provide a statistical blueprint of pixel intensity distribution. By visualizing these, I assessed the contrast levels and overall dynamic range of each image. Flat or tightly clustered histograms indicated low contrast, which could obscure cell boundaries. This step was key to choosing an appropriate enhancement method.\n\n\n3. Contrast Normalization: Let There Be Light (and Detail)\nI employed CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization), which adapts contrast enhancement locally, preserving edges while avoiding over-amplification of noise. This technique significantly brightens dim cell regions and defines boundaries better, making thresholding more effective.\n\n\n4. Thresholding: Rough Cut, Smart Strategy\nTo roughly segment cells, I compared Otsu's method and adaptive thresholding. Otsu assumes bimodal histogram distribution, which works well with well-separated foreground and background intensities. Adaptive thresholding adjusts thresholds based on local intensity, handling non-uniform illumination. Combining both using a logical AND created a more robust mask by leveraging their individual strengths.\n\n\n5. Morphological Operations: Sculpting the Cell Forms\nRaw masks from thresholding often contain noise and fragmented shapes. I applied morphological opening followed by closing using a disk-shaped structuring element. This removed small artifacts, filled holes, and produced smoother, more natural-looking cell regions. This step significantly improved the shape accuracy of the segmented cells.\n\n\n6. Connected Component Labeling: ID-ing the Cell Squad\nThis algorithm identifies distinct connected regions (potential cells) in the binary mask. I filtered out components with an area below 40 pixels to eliminate false positives. Bounding boxes were drawn to visualize the segmented cells, making it easy to inspect detection quality. This also allowed me to count and save the detected cells for further analysis.\n\n\n7. Visual Inspection & Insights\nEach step produced visual outputs saved as image files for comparison. I evaluated performance through overlays and bounding boxes, verifying that cells were well-localized and false positives were minimized. This visual feedback loop helped refine parameters like CLAHE clip limits and adaptive threshold sensitivity.\n\n\nReflections & Creative Tweaks\nThe creative decision to combine Otsu and adaptive thresholding provided a balanced approach to segmentation. I also experimented with varying the structuring element size and shape for morphological operations to match the typical cell scale and shape.\n\n\nConclusion: From Pixels to Purpose\nThis lab illustrated how foundational image processing techniques—when smartly combined—can effectively segment complex biomedical images. Each step, from contrast normalization to component analysis, plays a pivotal role in translating raw pixel data into structured, analyzable biological information. The structured pipeline not only segments but also quantifies cells, supporting further diagnostic or analytical tasks in biomedical contexts.\n######################\nOutput:"

Anyone can invest as much as they want and get tokens against their investments.\\nOn other hand eligible projects and ventures are funded by listing on Reals platform.\\nOn investing in the Reals platform, users receive digital tokens(PKR) against real estate tokens purchased. These Tokens(PKR) are stored in the user's web wallet.\\nUsing tokenization real estate investment makes it affordable for anyone. The cost of single Real token is the lowest investment price in real estate. Although traditional real estate paperwork takes 50,000 PKR to 1,000,000 PKR.\\nJOURNEY\\nThe Journey of Reals started when our client reached out with the request to build a Tokenization platform using Blockchain technology to make sure the security of the platform. A platform where people can create their own campaigns to collect investment and invest on otherâs campaigns.\\nWe designed the solution to use Ethereum blockchain that would give investors the security and peace of mind required for the safe investment and ownership of tokenized assets. Moreover, the reason behind incorporating the Ethereum network with Reals is that it has positive feedback for issuing tokens on the network. On Ethereum blockchain the real work asset is legally represented as a token and has all the valuable qualities of a cryptographic token while holding the original value of the asset.\\nAfter reaching an agreement, UX and UI were designed in close coordination with the client and then development started. After completing the development phase, the system was thoroughly tested and Demoed to mark this journey complete.\\nRESULTS\\nAs a result, Our client was able to submit the Reals project in SECP for the approval to make the project live for the public.\\nTECHNOLOGIES\\nAccording to the requirements provided by the client, we researched and chose the best technologies to implement the MVP in most efficient manner.

In the coming months, team will be adding more and more collections and have a process for requesting your collection to be added to the website. If you own any NFTs from the collections we support at launch, you are eligible to get a beta access key. The NFT pass will unlock the premium membership to the platform, including the ability to boost your posts, feature your NFT etc.\\nâ\\nEvery single NFT will have its own journey from owner to owner with each of them having their own portion to contribute to the mythology of the NFT. To know more about Track the Myth visit the FAQs section of TTM.\\nJOURNEY\\nThis journey started with the client wanting to create an MVP that can support around 4 - 6 NFT collections and 400 - 600 beta users at the very least. That could allow them to prove to the NFT community that they are offering a legitimate service that will eventually launch with additional features at launch.\\nWe proposed a solution to develop a Project that could convert this idea into a perfect reality. We designed the Prototypes and worked closely with the client to make sure the design is perfectly aligned with their ideas. After completing the design, our development team worked on completing the development phase by following scrum methodology. After completing the development, a testing phase was carried out in which all the feedback was incorporated.\\nRESULTS\\nAs a result of these efforts, Track the Myth has a landing page that gives information to users about the project and helps them connect their wallet to login into the user portal where they can use the portal as they want and enjoy all the functionalities we have worked on so far.\\nTECHNOLOGIES\\nTechnologies used in this projects are Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, React.js, Redux, Semantic UI, Web3.js, Truffle, Etherscan, Mocha, Heroku, and GitLab.\\nMore Projects\\nMore Projects\\nElection Management System is a portal created for the management of election results received from Electronic Voting Machine.\\nView Details\\nA Platform where motor enthusiast and NFT collectors come together.

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nDigital Image Processing Lab Report: Cell Image Segmentation\\n\\n\\nObjective\\nThe objective of this open-ended digital image processing lab is to enable students to apply essential image processing techniques in the application of cell image segmentation. The lab aims to provide hands-on experience in processing and analyzing biological cell images through various steps, including grayscale conversion, histogram analysis, contrast normalization, thresholding, morphological operations, and connected component analysis. By the end of the lab, students should be able to apply these techniques effectively to extract and segment cells from complex images, understand the impact of each step on the segmentation process, and justify their choices based on visual inspection.\\nData Set:\\nMIVIA HEp-2 Image dataset (28 images, one per patient)\\nProcess the images 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12 (The folder provided by the Lab instructor contains the binary mask labelled by expert is there just for reference)\\nLabeled Segmented Cells (1455 individual cells)\\nBinary masks describing the region of Interest (ROI)\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExplanation\\n\\n\\n1. Grayscale Conversion: The First Lens\\nThe foundation of digital image processing often begins with grayscale conversion. By eliminating color and focusing on intensity, we reduce computational complexity and isolate structural details. In this lab, RGB images were transformed using MATLAB's rgb2gray, which applies a weighted sum to retain perceptual brightness. This ensures the resulting image still reflects the inherent texture of cells, crucial for later stages.\\n\\n\\n2. Histogram Analysis: Reading the Intensity Landscape\\nHistograms provide a statistical blueprint of pixel intensity distribution. By visualizing these, I assessed the contrast levels and overall dynamic range of each image. Flat or tightly clustered histograms indicated low contrast, which could obscure cell boundaries. This step was key to choosing an appropriate enhancement method.\\n\\n\\n3. Contrast Normalization: Let There Be Light (and Detail)\\nI employed CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization), which adapts contrast enhancement locally, preserving edges while avoiding over-amplification of noise. This technique significantly brightens dim cell regions and defines boundaries better, making thresholding more effective.\\n\\n\\n4. Thresholding: Rough Cut, Smart Strategy\\nTo roughly segment cells, I compared Otsu's method and adaptive thresholding. Otsu assumes bimodal histogram distribution, which works well with well-separated foreground and background intensities. Adaptive thresholding adjusts thresholds based on local intensity, handling non-uniform illumination. Combining both using a logical AND created a more robust mask by leveraging their individual strengths.\\n\\n\\n5. Morphological Operations: Sculpting the Cell Forms\\nRaw masks from thresholding often contain noise and fragmented shapes. I applied morphological opening followed by closing using a disk-shaped structuring element. This removed small artifacts, filled holes, and produced smoother, more natural-looking cell regions. This step significantly improved the shape accuracy of the segmented cells.\\n\\n\\n6. Connected Component Labeling: ID-ing the Cell Squad\\nThis algorithm identifies distinct connected regions (potential cells) in the binary mask. I filtered out components with an area below 40 pixels to eliminate false positives. Bounding boxes were drawn to visualize the segmented cells, making it easy to inspect detection quality. This also allowed me to count and save the detected cells for further analysis.\\n\\n\\n7. Visual Inspection & Insights\\nEach step produced visual outputs saved as image files for comparison. I evaluated performance through overlays and bounding boxes, verifying that cells were well-localized and false positives were minimized. This visual feedback loop helped refine parameters like CLAHE clip limits and adaptive threshold sensitivity.\\n\\n\\nReflections & Creative Tweaks\\nThe creative decision to combine Otsu and adaptive thresholding provided a balanced approach to segmentation. I also experimented with varying the structuring element size and shape for morphological operations to match the typical cell scale and shape.\\n\\n\\nConclusion: From Pixels to Purpose\\nThis lab illustrated how foundational image processing techniques—when smartly combined—can effectively segment complex biomedical images. Each step, from contrast normalization to component analysis, plays a pivotal role in translating raw pixel data into structured, analyzable biological information. The structured pipeline not only segments but also quantifies cells, supporting further diagnostic or analytical tasks in biomedical contexts.\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"MIVIA HEp-2 Image dataset\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"A dataset of 28 HEp-2 cell images, one per patient, used for cell image segmentation in the lab.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"MATLAB\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"A software company that produces MATLAB, used in this lab for image processing tasks such as grayscale conversion.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Lab Instructor\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"The instructor who provided the image dataset and binary masks for reference in the lab.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"MIVIA HEp-2 Image dataset\\\"<|>\\\"Lab Instructor\\\"<|>\\\"The Lab Instructor provided the MIVIA HEp-2 Image dataset to the students for the lab.\\\" <|>\\\"data provision, instruction\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"MATLAB\\\"<|>\\\"Grayscale Conversion\\\"<|>\\\"MATLAB's rgb2gray function was used for grayscale conversion of the images.\\\" <|>\\\"software application, image processing\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"cell image segmentation, digital image processing, biomedical image analysis, MATLAB, histogram analysis, thresholding, morphological operations, connected component analysis\\\"<|> )<|COMPLETE|>\\n\\n\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

There are various factors that can be taken into account when rating the stability of an asset, including its track record of performance, the strength of the underlying market or industry, and the level of risk involved.\\nSome common tools used for stable rating include credit ratings, which evaluate the ability of a borrower to repay their debts, and risk ratings, which assess the likelihood of an investment losing value.\\nIt is important to note that the stability of an asset can change over time and that no rating system is foolproof. It is always a good idea to do your own research and due diligence before investing in any financial product.\\nJOURNEY\\nProblem: They wanted to make the GSU token accessible to people so we build this token on the ETH network.\\nOur solution: We built this decentralized exchange, where people can come and buy the GSU token. It is a stable rating mechanism and this system is currently a patent, a proprietary system. So we built oracles, which provide information to blockchain networks. We used oracles to bring rates to this exchange.\\nThey had built a global stability unit GSU.io along with their invention of a stable rate mechanism and now they wanted to make it accessible to people. We built it as an ERC20 on top of the ETH network. The token is upgradeable and has the support of the GSN network (eth gas station network so users don't have to pay the gas fee). They take their fee in GSU tokens so you can make the transaction without the gas fee.\\nRESULTS\\nResults: They were able to provide access to those who want access to GSU tokens through the ETH blockchain.\\nTECHNOLOGIES\\nTechnologies Used: VueJS, NodeJS, PostgresSQL, MariaDB, Redis, GoLang, Solidity, Ethereum, Bash, Docker\\nMore Projects\\nMore Projects\\nElection Management System is a portal created for the management of election results received from Electronic Voting Machine.\\nView Details\\nA Platform where motor enthusiast and NFT collectors come together.

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, use same language as input text. If English, capitalized the name.\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,category]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n- relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.\nFormat the content-level key words as (\"content_keywords\"<|><high_level_keywords>)\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n5.
