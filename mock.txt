**Searching for Google LLC details**

The user wants to add more information about Google LLC to a mock document. I’ll need to collect details like founding date, founders, revenue, employees, products, legal structure, subsidiaries, etc.

I’ll look this up using trusted sources like Wikipedia, Google’s official website, SEC filings, and others. I plan to get at least 10 diverse citations, and then I’ll organize everything into a summary and sections with the necessary markdown format.


Thought for 6 seconds


Here’s an expanded set of details you can drop into your mock document on **Google LLC**, organized into clear sections.

**Summary:**
Google LLC, founded on September 4, 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, is an American multinational technology subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Headquartered at the Googleplex in Mountain View, California, it commands roughly 92 % of the global search market and reported over \$282 billion in revenue for fiscal 2023. With around 183,000 employees worldwide, Google’s core products span search, advertising, cloud services, consumer hardware, and cutting-edge AI research.
